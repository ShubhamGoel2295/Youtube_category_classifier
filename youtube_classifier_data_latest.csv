There's a lot we can tell about an ancient building through archaeology and scientific research. We can tell when it was built, and usually how it was built, too. We might even be able to get an idea of what it was used for, but we can't always get all of the answers. Every structure you're about to see in this list is an outstanding feat of ancient construction, and although we know a little about all of them, we're still left with more questions than answers.

QLLpkUkgOk,A Black Hole That Broke the Science,"This year, on April 10th, scientists were finally able to do the unthinkable: they allowed humanity to look straight into the abyss of a super-massive black hole and take a photo like a tourist attraction! But even after these accomplishments, we still don‚Äôt know much about black holes at all, since one of them has challenged the whole scientific community with new impossible feats. 

In the middle of July 2019, black holes puzzled astronomers once again. New observations were made possible, thanks to the famed Hubble telescope, by a team of European scientists. Their study showed that a relatively small black hole contradicts all our expectations by almost completely mimicking its much bigger siblings.

3fYNON3Y_yQ,Top 17 hybrid animals created by scientists you won‚Äôt believe exist in 2020!!,"Top 17 hybrid animals created by scientists you won‚Äôt believe exist in 2020!!

You may have seen many things are done in the name of science. The scientist worked hard in order to provide food for a growing world population or to provide medicine and cures for sickness and disease. And today we'll show you some of craziest hybrids made by scientists that will have you believe they don't truly exist. 

Liger
It is the Combination between a male lion and a female tiger. They are usually larger and heavier than either of the parent species. The largest of these unique hybrid cats often grows to lengths of more than ten feet. And they can weigh up to a whopping 2,200 pounds. 
Killer bees
These creatures were accidentally created by scientists who were trying to increase honey production. European species of honeybees were introduced to South America. But because of the heat the bees would not collect honey. 

Cama 
Cama is a hybrid animal created by crossbreeding a one humped camel from Asia with the South American llama. Despite the difference in shape and their size the camel and a llama are actually distant relatives and evolved from the same ancestor. 

Super cows
The Belgian super cow is known as somewhat of a mutant breed of cattle. Its origins date back to the 1800s when Belgian scientists and farmers decided to breed native cattle with short horn cattle. Over time the breeders would select the biggest and strongest animals of each variety and breed them together. 

Genpet
This isn't a real animal created by scientists. And is probably one of the greatest hoaxes in modern history. The marketing behind this shrink-wrap pet was so good that many people believed that they were real. 

Sterile pink bollworm
The pink bollworm is a serious pest when it comes to cotton farming. Not only do the young larvae inflict damage to the cotton plant by their feeding they chew through the cotton lint to feed on the seeds. Since cotton is used for fiber and oil the damage is twofold. 

Glow fish 
Glow fish are a brand of genetically engineered fluorescent fish. The very first fish to hit the market was the zebrafish which come in a rainbow of colors including Starfire red electric green sunburst orange cosmic blue and galactic purple. 

Zorse
This crazy-looking horse will make you do a double-take and exclaim why does that horse have stripes. The source is a result of crossbreeding of a male zebra and a female horse. It turns out that the zebra part gives the horse high resistance to certain pests and diseases. 

Savannah
Many of you have probably seen this animal before because it is a favorite among celebrities. Savannah cats are spotted and is an animal that was bred to give the impression of grandeur and dignity of a wild cat with a cheetah or leopard like appearance. 

See-through frog.
Have you ever imagined a frog that can be see through? Japanese scientists created frogs that their skin is see-through in their early lives. It means that there is no need to dissect frogs for medical research as you can see right through. 

Enviropig
Enviropig was genetically engineered to produce up to less than 65% phosphorus through its urine and feces. The high phosphorus from their waste ends up in lakes rivers and ocean deltas. Where the high phosphorus wastes can cause outbursts of algae. 

Tigon
This one has a tiger head a bit of a lion's body with a tiger's tail. Tigers usually have a body length of 8 to 9 feet. Between 1936 and 1938 both the London Zoo and the Manchester zoo had Tagans.

Alligator snapping turtle
These creatures are prehistoric and brutal looking. And it's no surprise that their behavior matches their appearance with their spiked shell bear like jaws and thick scale the dragon tail. Interestingly enough they are often referred to as the dinosaur of the turtle world",Science

We love a good mystery. As fascinating as it is when an archaeologist pulls something out of the ground and is immediately able to tell us all about what it is, and what it says about the people who came before us, we're much more excited when they come across something they can't explain. Even with all our current technology, the amount of information we're missing about our ancestors and the way they lived is startling.

kvLv0Ne7-aU,japanese street food - okonomiyaki,"Okonomiyaki  o-konomi-yaki is a Japanese savory pancake containing a variety of ingredients. The name is derived from the word okonomi, meaning ""how you like"" or ""what you like"", and yaki meaning ""grill"". Okonomiyaki is mainly associated with the Kansai or Hiroshima areas of Japan, but is widely available throughout the country. Toppings and batters tend to vary according to region. In Tokyo, there is a semi-liquid okonomiyaki called 'monjayaki.'
Kansai- or Osaka-style okonomiyaki is the predominant version of the dish, found throughout most of Japan. The batter is made of flour, grated nagaimo (a type of yam), water or dashi, eggs and shredded cabbage, and usually contains other ingredients such as green onion, meat (generally thin pork belly, often mistaken for bacon), octopus, squid, shrimp, vegetables, konjac, mochi or cheese. Okonomiyaki is sometimes compared to an omelette or a pancake and may be referred to as a ""Japanese pizza"" or ""Osaka soul food""
Some okonomiyaki restaurants are grill-it-yourself establishments, where the server produces a bowl of raw ingredients that the customer mixes and grills at tables fitted with teppan, or special hotplates. They may also have a diner-style counter where the cook prepares the dish in front of the customers.
In Osaka (the largest city in the Kansai region), where this dish is said to have originated, okonomiyaki is prepared much like a pancake. The batter and other ingredients are pan-fried on both sides on either a teppan or a pan using metal spatulas that are later used to slice the dish when it has finished cooking. Cooked okonomiyaki is topped with ingredients that include otafuku/okonomiyaki sauce (similar to Worcestershire sauce but thicker and sweeter), aonori (seaweed flakes), katsuobushi (bonito flakes), Japanese mayonnaise, and pickled ginger (beni shoga).",Food

These flavors are key in not only making us feel happy but also in solidifying these dishes in our memories. Twenty people from different cultural backgrounds shared what their favorite comfort food is and what it means to them, and we looked at how their dish of choice is made.

PGM-070kW-,"Rick Steves' ""No-Travel Tips""","Europe has re-opened to travelers...except Americans. It seems that the USA's quarantine skills just aren't up to snuff. And, judging from the new coronavirus cases sweeping our country, we have a lot of room for improvement. If you want to flatten our curve so we can head back to Europe, the recipe is simple: Self-isolate at home as much as possible. If you're out in public, socially distance. And be sure to wear a mask.
 
In the meantime, it seems that we may be stuck at home for a while longer. If you're like me, more than 100 days of staying close to home is wearing thin (even though it's just as important as ever). Sometime during the haze of quarantine, I started brainstorming ways that travelers can bring a little bit of Europe into our daily lives during this crisis. This video offers a few suggestions.

PGM-070kW-,"Rick Steves' ""No-Travel Tips""","Europe has re-opened to travelers...except Americans. It seems that the USA's quarantine skills just aren't up to snuff. And, judging from the new coronavirus cases sweeping our country, we have a lot of room for improvement. If you want to flatten our curve so we can head back to Europe, the recipe is simple: Self-isolate at home as much as possible. If you're out in public, socially distance. And be sure to wear a mask.
 
In the meantime, it seems that we may be stuck at home for a while longer. If you're like me, more than 100 days of staying close to home is wearing thin (even though it's just as important as ever). Sometime during the haze of quarantine, I started brainstorming ways that travelers can bring a little bit of Europe into our daily lives during this crisis. This video offers a few suggestions.

You can melt some soap base, place it in a syringe and then transfer it into little containers ( empty gum containers or ice-cube trays) Let it cool, and then every time you‚Äôre about to wash your hands, take out one little blob. 
You can do the same with toothpaste. Add some blobs on a piece of greaseproof paper, sprinkle some baking soda on top and finally, transfer them in a container. 
For the campers out there, I show you how to make your own fire starters using nail polish. Simply add some layers of nail polish on a few cotton pads and voila. 
To prevent your matches from getting wet, place them in a tightly sealed container. 
To keep your money safe while traveling, simply put them inside your hairbrush, soap or sanitary pad.

Truth is, I had just moved away from my friends and family and I started to feel very home sick and lonely like I didn‚Äôt belong in my new settings. Everything was just happening so fast and I couldn‚Äôt really grasp where I was or who I was but all i knew was that I felt Alone. With the music video, we really wanted to send a message. Nobody knows how you feel, whether you‚Äôre homesick, away from friends and family, or if you simply aren‚Äôt like everyone else‚Ä¶its ok. The whole purpose of the Marshmello project and the Mellogang is to bring together people from every corner of the world and create a family‚Ä¶a family that we can all count on to never let us feel Alone. I hope you guys enjoy this video as much as I do. It gives me the feels for sure.
